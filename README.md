This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Supabase auth is wired but currently disabled in production. You can re-enable it later by removing the temporary redirect on `/login` and adjusting middleware/protected routes.

üß™ Testing the Engine

The game logic is pure and easy to test. Example test ideas:

`applyMove` drops to the lowest open row

`checkWin` detects horizontal / vertical / diagonal

Draw detection when board is full

üß≠ Roadmap

‚úÖ Human vs Computer (alpha-beta minimax)

‚úÖ Ghost previews, drop animation, win celebration

‚è≥ Saved W/L/T history per user (Supabase + RLS)

‚è≥ Realtime PvP across devices (Supabase Realtime)

‚è≥ Replay viewer (step through moves)

üñºÔ∏è Screens / GIF

(Add a short GIF of gameplay here ‚Äî ghost preview ‚Üí drop ‚Üí win confetti.)

üõ†Ô∏è Deploy

Deployed on Vercel (one-click from GitHub). Environment variables are only required when enabling Supabase auth/history.

If you want, I can also generate a crisp **Open Graph image** (OG) for pretty link previews and add a couple of **engine unit tests** to kickstart the `/__tests__` folder.
